# LLM Tutorial

This repo contains notebooks which walk you through some simple LLM implementations. It uses free software and can all be run inside Google Collab, for maximum accessibility.

## Description

This repo contains a tutorial showcasing how simple it is to begin using open-source LLMs in Python.

It shows the use of three models:

* Phi3
* Grammarly CoEdit
* Cappy

The tutorial is designed to be run in Google Colab - to allow it to be freely and easily used by anyone who wants to learn.

## Prerequisites

- knowledge-wise, some ability with python. Knowledge of data science would be useful, but not crucial (at least at the start). Interest in LLMs will help!
- system-wise: the requirements can be found in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file, and can be loaded `pip`.

## Getting Started
### Google Colab
Open one of the Google Colab links above! This repo is meant to be used in Google Colab for demo and teaching purposes.

### Clone the repo

Clone the repository. To learn about what this means, and how to use Git, see the [Git guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/using-git-collaboratively/).

```
git clone <insert URL>
```

### install dependencies

Make a [virtual environment](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/python/virtual-environments/venv/) and install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Adapting for your project

Just take whatever code you need, and reimplement it. This was made mostly in the form of Jupyter notebooks for ease of use and demos, however I wouldn't recommend that for most applications - but it can be very useful when getting started and playing with the code.
